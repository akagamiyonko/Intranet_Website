I am currently working on an intranet website for MTA employees.
The site will migrate from a previous legacy website that had all
the different agencys and departments separated and bring it all 
together for over 80,000 employees to use.

The exel file containes my hours of work during a specific day
and the work that was done during that time. 

Most of my work is working on assigned JIRA stories which 
are given to me by my supervisor but it also might be from 
areas that I am interested on working on.

We use agile as a project managment board and work and keep track 
of our work with a two week sprint. During those two weeks I am assigned 
a specific ticket to work on and give updates to the team through 
a Scrum Daily Standup meeting.

I am unable to share the exact work that I am doing as it is not for the public 
and also it is still a developing product. On the folder Stories are included 
screenshots of the stories that I have completed and the ones I am currently
working on with some of the information redacted.
They will be updated every two weeks.
