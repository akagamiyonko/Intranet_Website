I am currently working on an intranet website for MTA employees.
The site will migrate from a previous legacy website that had all
the different agencys and departments separated and bring it all 
together for over 80,000 employees to use.

The exel file containes my hours of work during a specific day
and the work that was done during that time. 

Most of my work is working on assigned JIRA stories which 
are given to me by my supervisor but it also might be from 
areas that I am interested on working on.
